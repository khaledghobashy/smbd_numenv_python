## Features

- Code-generation for symbolic standalone topologies and template-based topologies.

- Solver for **Kinematically Driven Systems** that can be used for forward and inverse kinematic analysis as well as inverse dynamic analysis.
- Solver for **Dynamically Driven Systems** that can be used for forward dynamic analysis and equilibrium analysis.
